# Diabetes-Prediction-System
An ML flask application which predicts early diabetes by using decision tree algorithm.  


### **Problem Statement** :
Diabetes is a condition in whichÂ blood glucose, often known as blood sugar, is excessively high.People in India's cities and urban areas are more prone than ever before to get diabetes. This is due, in part, to cities encouraging a lifestyle that might raise a person's body mass index (BMI) which is risk factor for diabetes. Overweight, Obesity and an inactive lifestyle are the most common causes of diabetes.Therefore, Test and Prediction of Diabetes at earliest is much needed to lead better life.  

### **Project Description** : 
#### Algorithm -  
The Diabetes Prediction System uses Machine learning approach which are commonly employed in diabetes prediction, and generally produce good results. **Decision Trees** are popular machine learning algorithms in the medical area because of their high classification power. 
#### Dataset -  
There are 750+ samples in the dataset. The data for training and testing is divided in a 70-30 ratio. The dataset is separated into two sections, healthy persons and diabetics.  A decision tree's basic purpose is to divide a group of data into smaller parts. The Decision Tree Algorithm Predicts the Diabetes considering diffterent features such as Age, Blood Pressure, Glucose level and BMI etc. 

The given system also creates an overall report of prediction which user can save for furthur use. For better user interaction, The Flask Application is created, which is user friendly and can be used by any novice user and doctors.   

### Technologies Used :  
- Python 3.0
- Flask
- HTML5
- CSS3 and Bootstrap4
- Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn Libraries
