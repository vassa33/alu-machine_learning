# Diabetes-Prediction-System
An ML system that predicts early diabetes by using a decision tree algorithm.  


### **Problem Statement** :
Diabetes is a condition in whichÂ blood glucose, often known as blood sugar, is excessively high. People in India's cities and urban areas are more prone than ever before to get diabetes. This is due, in part, to cities encouraging a lifestyle that might raise a person's body mass index (BMI), which is a risk factor for diabetes. Overweight, Obesity and an inactive lifestyle are the most common causes of diabetes. Therefore, Test and Prediction of Diabetes at the earliest is much needed to lead a better life.  

### **Project Description** : 
#### Algorithm -  
The Diabetes Prediction System uses a Machine learning approach, which is commonly employed in diabetes prediction and generally produces good results. **Decision Trees** are popular machine learning algorithms in the medical area because of their high classification power. 
#### Dataset -  
There are 750+ samples in the dataset. The data for training and testing is divided into a 70-30 ratio. The dataset is separated into two sections: healthy persons and diabetics.  A decision tree's basic purpose is to divide a group of data into smaller parts. The Decision Tree Algorithm Predicts Diabetes by considering age, Blood Pressure, Glucose level, B.M.I., etc. 
  

### Technologies Used :  
- Python
- Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn Libraries
