# Binary Classification
The goal of this project is to perform image classification, where the algoritm has to choose if the pic corresponds to number 1 or number 0.

I needed to learn the following topics to have a solid foundation:

Models.
Supervised Learning.
Prediction.
Node.
Weight.
Bias.
Activation Functions.
Sigmoid.
Tanh.
Relu.
Softmax.
Neuron.
Neural Network Layers.
Logistic Regression.
Loss Function.
Cost Function.
Forward Propagation.
Gradient Descent.
Back Propagation.
Computation Graph.
Weights/Biases initialization.
Numpy to perform linear algebra operations.
To achieve the classification were coded three ways to perform it:

Sigmoid Neuron.
Two-Layers Neural Network.
Deep Neural Network.
