In machine learning, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of a model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of the underlying patterns. Regularization introduces a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging overly complex models that might fit the training data perfectly but struggle to generalize to new, unseen data.

There are two common types of regularization techniques:

1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**
   - In L1 regularization, a penalty is added to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients. This regularization technique encourages sparsity in the model, meaning that some of the coefficients may become exactly zero. It effectively performs feature selection by eliminating less important features.

   - The regularized cost function is given by:
     ~~~ \[ \text{Cost} = \text{Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i| \] ~~~
     where \( \lambda \) is the regularization strength, and \( w_i \) are the model parameters.

2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**
   - In L2 regularization, a penalty term is added to the loss function that is proportional to the squared values of the model's coefficients. Unlike L1 regularization, L2 regularization tends to distribute the importance more evenly among all features, and none become exactly zero.

   - The regularized cost function is given by:
     ~~~\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Loss} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \]~~~
     where \( \lambda \) is the regularization strength, and \( w_i \) are the model parameters.

The regularization strength (\( \lambda \)) is a hyperparameter that controls the amount of regularization applied to the model. A higher \( \lambda \) value leads to stronger regularization.

Regularization is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when the number of features is comparable to the number of observations. It helps to create a more robust model that performs well on new, unseen data by discouraging the model from fitting the noise in the training data.
