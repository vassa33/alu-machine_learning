In machine learning, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of a model. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data instead of the underlying patterns. Regularization introduces a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging overly complex models that might fit the training data perfectly but struggle to generalize to new, unseen data.


Regularization is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when the number of features is comparable to the number of observations. It helps to create a more robust model that performs well on new, unseen data by discouraging the model from fitting the noise in the training data.
