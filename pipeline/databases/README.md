After fetching data via APIs, storing them is also really important for training a Machine Learning model.

You have multiple option:

* Relation database
* Not Relation database
* Key-Value storage
* Document storage
* Data Lake
* etc.

In this project, I will touch the first 2: relation and not relation database.

Relation databases are mainly used for application, not for source of data for training your ML models, but it can be really useful for the data processing, labeling and injection in another data storage. In this project, I will play with basic SQL commands and also create automation and computing on data directly in SQL - less load at my application level since the computing power is dispatched to the database.

Not relation databases, known as NoSQL, will give flexibility on the data: document, versioning, not a fix schema, no validation to improve performance, complex lookup, etc.
